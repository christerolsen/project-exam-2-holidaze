## Description

Holidaze is a venue booking application that allows users to browse, book, manage, and host vacation properties. Users can create and manage venues, view bookings, and manage their profile details. This application is built with React, leveraging a backend API for data management and user authentication.

## Assignment brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## Project's goal

To take the skills learned over the last two/four(part-time) years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

  - Custom box shadow `rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.5)` for card elements and modal styling.
- **Breakpoints**:
  - `mobile`: `450px`
  - `tablet`: `640px`
  - `laptop`: `1024px`
  - `desktop`: `1280px`

### Responsive Design
